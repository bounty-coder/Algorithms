# Given two integers representing the numerator and denominator
#  of a fraction, return the fraction in string format.

# Given numerator = 1, denominator = 2, return "0.5"
# Given numerator = 2, denominator = 1, return "2"
# Given numerator = 2, denominator = 3, return "0.(6)"

# The idea is to first calculate the absolute part before 
# decimal point and then calculate the fractional part.
# To check if the fractional part is repeating, insert the 
# remainder (numerator % denominator) in a map with key as 
# remainder and value as the index position at which this 
# remainder occurs. If at any point of time, the remainder 
# becomes zero, then there doesnâ€™t exist a repeating fraction 
# otherwise if the remainder is already found in the map, 
# then there exists a repeating fraction.
