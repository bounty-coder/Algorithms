Binary tree


Binary search tree



Threaded Binary tree:
The idea of threaded binary trees is to make inorder traversal faster
and do it without stack and without recursion.A binary tree is made 
threaded by making all right child pointers that would normally be 
NULL point to the inorder successor of the node (if it exists).

Single Threaded: Where a NULL right pointers is made to point to
 the inorder successor (if successor exists)
Double Threaded: Where both left and right NULL pointers are made 
to point to inorder predecessor and inorder successor respectively.

class Node:
    def __init__(self, data,rightThread):
        self.data = data;
        self.left = None;
        self.right = None;
        self.rightThread = rightThread;
