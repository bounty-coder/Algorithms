# Topological sorting in graph is a linear ordering of vertices such
# that for every directed edge u v, vertex u comes before v in the ordering.

# only possible for DAG (directed acyclic graphs)

#  2  -> 3  -> 1
#  |^          |^
#  5  -> 0  <- 4 

# op- 5 4 2 3 1 0 

#approach
# similar to dfs traversal. We can modify DFS to find Topological Sorting.
# In DFS, we start from a vertex, we first print it and then recursively 
# call DFS for its adjacent vertices. 
# But in Topological sorting. We will also use a stack. We donâ€™t print the
# vertex immediately, we first recursively call topological sorting for
# all its adjacent vertices, then push it to a stack.

# TC- O(N+E)  SC-O(N)

    #Function to return list containing vertices in Topological order.
