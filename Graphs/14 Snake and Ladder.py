# Given a 10*10 snake and ladder board, find the minimum no of dice 
# to be rolled to end the game.
 
#approach-
# Clearly, See the board as a graph/matrix. Each block can be represented as
# a vertex. Each possible move from a dice roll is an edge. We have choices from 
# 1 to 6 for traversing and start vertex is 1 and end vertex is 100.
# for 99 it has only 1 edge, for block 98- 2 edges...
# Next modifying this graph on the based input ladders and snakes
# For ex. if we reach 32 it will move to 62(by ladder). So, better to replace
# all vertex pointing to 32 to 62. and so for the all ladders and snakes.
# As it is the unweighted graph, We have to find the shortest distance/path from
# source node to the destination node which can be processed by bfs traversal.
# Dfs can also be used for traversal, but it doesn't make any sense here to use it.
# as we first have to see all the dice moves 1 to 6 then move on which is possible 
# by bfs only.

# approach 1 ( if board not already given, make your own board)
# A- ladders , B- Snakes
# A = [  [32, 62], [42, 68], [12, 98] ]  
#  B = [  [95, 13] [97, 25] [93, 37] [79, 27] [75, 19]
#         [49, 47] [67, 17] ]
# output: 3
