# Python program to detect cycle in a graph
 
# Algorithm: 
# Create the graph using the given number of edges and vertices.
# Create a recursive function that initializes the current index or vertex,
#  visited, and recursion stack.
# Mark the current node as visited and also mark the index in recursion stack.
# Find all the vertices which are not visited and are adjacent to the current node.
#  Recursively call the function for those vertices, 
# If the recursive function returns true, return true.
# If the adjacent vertices are already marked in the recursion stack then return true.
# Create a wrapper class, that calls the recursive function for all the vertices and 
# if any function returns true return true. 
# Else if for all vertices the function returns false return false.

# defaultdict is a dict but defaultdict never raises error
