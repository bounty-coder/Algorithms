# You are given two integers (X) and (Y). You have to count the number of binary strings which have (X) 1â€™s and (Y) 0â€™s, and there are no two consecutive 1â€™s in the string.
# Note: The answer can be too large, so return it with modulo (10^9 + 7)

# The problem can be solved using combinatorial mathematics, 
# consider the problem as placing X 1's into Y + 1 gaps created by Y 0's, and use combinations to count the valid arrangements.
# We will have to calculate (Y+1)CX.

class Solution:
    def CountString(self,X,Y):
        mod = 10**9+7
        def ncr(n,r):
            r = min(r,n-r)
            nr = 1
            dr = 1
            for i in range(r):
                nr  = (nr*(n-i))%mod
                dr = (dr*(i+1))%mod
            
            return (nr*pow(dr,mod-2,mod))%mod
        
        if X>Y+1:
            return 0
        return ncr(Y+1,X)
