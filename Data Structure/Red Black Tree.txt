Red black tree is a specific type of binary search tree.
It is balanced binary search tree.

Criteria:
1) Nodes are either black or red
2) The root and leaves(NIL) are black
3) If a node is red, then its children are black.
4) All paths from a node to its NIL descendants contain the same number of nodes.

More points:
1) Nodes requires one storage bit to keep track of color
2) Longest path is no more than twice of the shortest path.
    - shortest path : all black nodes
    - longest node  : alternating red and black

We can do:
Search - O(logn)
Remove - O(logn)
Insert - O(logn)

Space complexity - O(n)


Removing/ Inserting change the RB tree, and may voilate the property. To fix it, we rotate if violating
1) Left rotate
2) right rotate
