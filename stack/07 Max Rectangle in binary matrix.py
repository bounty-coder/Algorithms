# Given a binary matrix, find the maximum size rectangle 
# binary-sub-matrix with all 1â€™s. 

#    Input:
#    0 1 1 0
#    1 1 1 1
#    1 1 1 1
#    1 1 0 0
# Output : 8

# approach
# See through the previous problem, try to make histograms.
# starting from 0th row, add previous row height to current row 
# for each column. If height is 0 somewhere, make the height of 
# building 0(hawe p to rhegi nhi building)
# modified array will be for above example:

# 0 1 1 0
# 1 2 2 1
# 2 3 3 2
# 3 4 0 0
