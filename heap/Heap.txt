A Heap is a special Tree-based data structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree.
two types: Max-Heap & Min-Heap

A binary heap is typically represented as an array.
The root element will be at Arr[0].
Arr[(i-1)/2]	Returns the parent node
Arr[(2*i)+1]	Returns the left child node
Arr[(2*i)+2]	Returns the right child node

Insertion:
1) Insert at the last avaible position
2) a) Min-Heap
Compare data we just inserted to parents data. If its less than the parents,
we swap. Continue to do this until we reach the root node
 b) Max-Heap
Compare data we just inserted to parents data. If it's greater than the parents,
 we swap. Continue to do this until we reach the root node
