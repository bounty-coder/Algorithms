# Note: It is assumed that all elements of array are distinct.
# A simple solution is to do linear search for k closest elements. 
# 1) Start from the first element and search for the crossover
#    point (The point before which elements are smaller than or
#  equal to X and after which elements are greater). 
# This step takes O(n) time. 
# 2) Once we find the crossover point,
#  we can compare elements on both sides of crossover
# point to print k closest elements. This step takes O(k) time.
# The time complexity of the above solution is O(n).

# An Optimized Solution is to find k elements in O(Logn + k) time.
#  The idea is to use Binary Search to find the crossover point.
# Once we find index of crossover point, 
# we can print k closest elements in O(k) time.
