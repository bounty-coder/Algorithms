'''
In a restaurant, two waiters, A and B, receive n orders per day, earning tips as per arrays arr[i] and brr[i] respectively. If A takes the ith order, the tip is arr[i] rupees; if B takes it, the tip is brr[i] rupees.

To maximize total tips, they must distribute the orders such that:

A can handle at most x orders
B can handle at most y orders
Given that x + y â‰¥ n, all orders can be managed by either A or B. Return the maximum possible total tip after processing all the orders.

# step1 we create pair the differnce array and index
# step2 Now we find the differnce between the array and kept them with their index
# step 3 now we sort  the array so that we can get the highest differnce consecutively
# step 4 now we travel through that diffence of the array from back so that we can get largest differnce and compare the arr and brr so same index 
# step 5 so which one is high we will add that to the ans
